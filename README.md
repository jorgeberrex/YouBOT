# YouBOT
The most useless and self-centered Discord bot you'll ever find

## `config.json` structure:
```JSON
{
  "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
  "keywords": ["YOUR_NAME", "SECOND_KEYWORD_FOR_SOME_REASON"],
  "cooldown": 4000,
  "cooldownMessage": "bruh, you are going too fast, wait %seconds% seconds"
}
```
The `cooldown` field is time in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second)


## `quotes.json` structure:
```JSON
[
  "I am so good looking",
  "This bot is not good, who even made this",
  "I am testing stuff ok?",
  "Get off my lawn"
]
```
